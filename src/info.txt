#folder with core routines
#developed by F.Roux 2012-2016


#apply_smoothing2features.m -> this routine is for smoothing feature data in time
#chronset_demo.m -> a demo file (needs to be updated)
#compute_feat_data.m -> master script that launches spectral analysis and computes the features that are used for speech onset detection
#compute_goodness_of_pitch.m -> GOD extraction (function is depreciated and not longer used by current version of chronset)
#compute_Speech_features.m -> core routine that computes speech features, called by compute_feat_data.m
#compute_treshold_xing.m -> detection of threshold crossings
#detect_speech_on_and_offset.m -> routine that permforms speech on and offset detection
#syllabel_counter.m -> count vocal units
#chronset_extract_thresholds.m -> extracts the thresholds based on the findings reported by Roux et al. (2016)
